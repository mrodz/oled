# LVGL Framework Usage ⚠️
This project requires LVGL, which itself requires a configuration file placed in the same working directory as the `/lvgl` folder. For PlatformIO, this is in the `.pio/libdeps/stable` folder.

Simply drag and drop `lv_conf.h` to this location in order to be able to compile.
